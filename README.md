# Cantankerous's Collapsible Castle

To my players: this is where I keep all the static game data for the game. Reading beyond what is on this page would count as cheating. You're welcome to, but I reserve the right to improvise in order to keep you guessing. >;)

Laws of the pocket-dimension:
----------------------------

- Daedalus assures me he's be in far more dangerous places, and we'll get out of this yet. He saved the world, don't you know? Along with his party of ten or mildly competent sidekicks.
- Hunger and thirst are not felt, though if you're feeling nostalgic, you may ask the nearest wall for food. Often they spit out loaves of horrible tasting purple bread.
- As the legend goes, anyone who reaches the top of the Castle, the tenth floor, and seeks an audience with Cantankerous will have one Wish(as per spell) of their choice granted. This is the only known means of escape. Those who wish for escape are not seen within the Castle ever again.
- Convenient navigation numbers are engraved on every staircase so that you'll know how high you've ascended. Each 10x10ft chunk of the entire castle seems to be clearly marked, including a small symbol that appears to be a coordinate system. No, Daedalus has not made paper maps and will not help you navigate. Paper is for making more scrolls of Cone of Cold, is what he told me. He only let me keep this one tiny journal.
- There seems to be only a single staircase up and down per floor. A clever mage with firm knowledge of the coordinate system attempted to teleport vertically to ascend floors, he was never heard from again.
- Treasure can be found on the persons of monsters, other adventurers and in chests. Chests are sometimes rigged with traps. Daedalus suggests scouting ahead while others deal with the mundanities of loot. Who needs money in here anyway?
- Doors require a STR check to open, and tend to close when no one actively looking at them. Doors can be destroyed like any other object, but seem to reappear over time.
- The walls of the dungeon can be cut by raw damage, but this usually draws the ire of the Custodian. Daedalus claims to have killed it once. When it appeared again there were two of them.
- There seems to be a single merchant on each floor. Pleasant purple-clad hooded fellow. Always has three items for sale. Once you buy out his stock, he disappears. Attacking him also results in his disappearance, and the arrival of at least one Custodian.
- Monsters seem to be incapable of ascending or descending staircases, nor does combat on staircases seem to be an option. Daedalus suspects that the physical stairs are for show and that the actual effect is one of a still spell+silent spell permanent teleport.
- Portals that appear to lead to other planes in all cases thus far have been deceptive in nature, in fact leading to pocket realms that mimic the effects of other planes. These portals are unanchored within the Castle itself and Daedalus has not deemed it a high priority to figure out their patterns of travel, if any.
- Sometimes stairs lead to intermediary floors which Daedalus describes as "large open arenas" populated with "mildly irritating foes" These rooms appear to have no exit, and must be cleared of monsters for the way out to be revealed. Known arena as reported by D. activates on the stairs between F2 and F3.
- Death seems to involve negotiating with DEATH itself personified. Reports on this vary. In some cases DEATH asked riddles, in other cases he asked for a trade involving arbitrary concepts. What's a "-2 CON SCORE" mean anyway?
- These notes provided by only other member of The Wizard's College on this plane, working under threat of "being forced to explore the damn place" by Daedalus. Signed: Wizard of Stone.

PS: I'll be on floor 0. And no, I don't have any items worth mugging me for, unless you really want my notebook, quill and ink pot.
